_1888 - London - Whitechapel district The night covers the gloomy alleys with a veil of darkness. Jack the ripper is moving in the shadows... The finest investigators of the gaslight age have gathered here to catch him before he uses the darkness to slip away for good. The trap is slowly closing upon him... But Jack is cunning. He is in fact impersonating one of the investigators... Will the others unmask him?_

One of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the 8 characters on the board. This player knows the identity of this character and his goal is to flee from the district as soon as possible (or avoid being accused for eight turns). The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack. But he can make only one accusation during the game!

During each turn the players move the characters, using their special powers, placing them either in shadow or light. At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare if Jack is visible (in light, or adjacent to another character) or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. This continues as the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants.
